# Avans-Plus-Eindopdracht

Avans Plus Bakkerij Eindopdracht
(Avans Plus Bakery Final assignment)

November 2021 I graduated 'C# programming' a post bachelor (HBO) college course at Avans hogeschool (certificate of participation and assessment). The final assignment was to program an object orientated information system for a bakery maintaining employee, customer and product data as functionalities and give a final presentation of it. This is the code I wrote.
